Through the "Insert ASM" option, one can insert ASM directly into the file,
at certain locations. 

But before that...you must know the ASM you are inserting.
Ultimately, you should be able to tell what the code you are putting in does.
You can use one of the many GB/C ASM resources available to learn more.

Allowed words:
Any of these language words:
adc, add, and, bit, ccf, cp, cpl, daa, dec, di, ei, halt, inc, jp, jr, ld, ldd
ldhl, ldi, ldio, nop, or, pop, push, res, ret, reti, rl, rla, rlc, rlca, rr,
rra, rrc, rrca, rst, sbc, scf, set, sla, sra, srl, stop, sub, sub, swap, swap,
xor

As well as these directives (for data):
db, dw

Numbers:
Several different formats are supported:
Regular numbers (no prefix): 34, 103
Binary numbers (%) : %1101, %10001001
Hex numbers ($) : $3F, $FF45
Octal numbers (&) : &77, &34

Any place where a number is accepted, an expression can be created. So, you
can do something like:

ld bc,TableBase + ($44 << 3)

Supported operations, in order of precedence (high to low):
~ (One's complement), - (Negative sign), ! (Unary boolean not)
* (Multiply) / (Divide) % (Mod)
+ (Add) - (Subtract)
<< (left shift) >> (right shift)
< (Less) > (Greater) <= (Less or equal) >= (Greater or equal)
== (equivalence operator)
& (binary and)
^ (binary xor)
| (binary or)
&& (boolean and)
|| (boolean or)
? : (conditional expression)

Boolean operations return either a 1 (true), or 0 (false). A number evaluates
to true if it's not equal to 0.

Parenthesis can be used to group operations together.

The final result of any expression will be truncated to fit into instructions,
so be careful to know what type of number will be produced in the end

Ex: ld a,$5000 + $34
THe second argument takes a byte, so in the end, $5034 will be truncated to
$34.

Labels/Variables:
Label and variable names have to start with a letter, and can contain letters,
numbers, or underscores. Don't redefine a label or variable (or register) that
already exists.

Registers:
Depending on the instruction, you'll be able to use the register singles
(b, c, d, e, h, l, [hl], a), register doubles (bc, de, hl, af, sp), and so
on.

Features:
Variable definition:
Define certain values, using ([name] equ [value]), or ([name] = [value])
Ex: 
var2 equ $3456
var3 = $234
Variables have no limit in themselves, but will be extended (or truncated) to
fit the instruction that you use them in (either to the size of a byte, or a
short).

Label definition:
You can define temporary labels while you're typing (for the purpose of call
/jp/jr, for example), or use labels that you've already defined.
Ex:
label1:
ldi [hl],a
dec bc
ld a,b
or c
jr label1

Data definition:
You can specify data to insert, at any place. Start with the size of data (db,
dw, dd, dq), then the list of data being inserted, separated by commas.
Variables and expressions can also be used in these definitions.
Ex:
db $23,$34,VAR_NAME
dw $3149,$4794,$15F
dd $43245628
dq $993F6523B7D63468

db : Byte
dw : Word (16-bit)
dd : Dword (32-bit)
dq : Qword (64-bit)

As with instructions, if numbers are too wide or too
short, they will be extended or truncated to fit. For example,

db $6534

will be interpreted as

db $34

.

Comments:
Append single line comments to lines with #, or ;.
Ex:

#This is a comment.
ld a,b ;This is also a comment.

C-style comments are also fine.

//This is a single line comment.

/* This is a
multiline comment.*/

Instructions:
Just type the appropriate instruction in the proper place.
Instruction Format:
[inst] [arg1],[arg2]
There are certain instructions that will be written differently, depending on
what you are used to working with in other assemblers.

Load Increase/Decrease A,[HL]/[HL],A
ldd a,[hl] ldd [hl],a
ldi a,[hl] ldi [hl],a

Load [Location],A/A,[Location]
This instruction will use the shorter form of the instruction (E0/F0)
depending on whether the called location resides in [$FF00-$FFFF] or not.
To make it explicit, use ldio:

ldio a,[$34] -> ld a,[$FF34]

Load HL, SP + Offset
ldhl sp,x

Load [$FFCC],A/A,[$FFCC]
ld [c],a ld a,[c]

Stop
When converting to bytecode, a NOP will be inserted after it, to allow for the
behavior of the processor after executing this instruction.

Jump Relative
Sometimes a jump will be possible, and sometimes it won't, like when the
offset being jumped to lies outside of the range of jr. For this
instruction, you can use a label, or an offset, to specify where to jump to.

Macros:
When you need to encapsulate some code to be inserted anywhere, instead of
copying/pasting all over the place, you can make a macro to use. To do so:
MacroName: MACRO
...instructions...
ENDM

THe macroname follows the same rules as labels. Macros start and end with
MACRO and ENDM, respectively. To use a macro, just type its name.

MacroName

You can also include arguments along with the macros. These arguments are
expressions, and will be evaluated as such. Up to 9 arguments, separated by
commas, are allowed.

MacroName $10, $20 >> 3, (34 + (%1101 << 4)) * $40

To access an argument inside a macro, use \1, \2, ... \9, for the 1st arg, the
2nd arg, and so on. Each argument is evaluated as if it has parentheses around
it, so do not worry about including parentheses around an argument in a macro
call.

MacroName: MACRO
ld a,\1
ld b,\2 << 3
db \3, \4 * 1000
ENDM
